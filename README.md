# RFID based smart trolley

The smart trolley has an RFID reader [EM 18 module] and an LCD display attached to it.
RFID and LCD display use serial mode communication. Each item has an RFID tag
attached to it. The customers have their own cards. At first, when the customer scans his
card, a welcome message is displayed. As he adds the items to the cart, the name of the
item and its price along with the total are displayed on the LCD display. If he removes an
item, the price of that item is deducted from the total and the revised total amount will be
displayed. At the end of shopping, a Thank You message is displayed.
